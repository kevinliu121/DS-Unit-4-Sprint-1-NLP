Keep part in this assignment - produce a write-up of the attributes of the best and worst coffee shops. Based on your analysis, what makes the best the best and the worst the worst. Use graphs and numbesr from your analysis to support your conclusions. There should be plenty of markdown cells! :coffee:"

              "Came in on the first day of opening, hours currently 6am-2pm. At some point they'll stay open till 12 midnight. I think this might be the most beautiful cafe in Austin, the interior is charming, snazzy, cozy. There's even a pair of swings to sit on while you enjoy your coffee and play a game of chess. I ordered the Marymint Monroe, basically a mint mojito. It's been a while since I've been to Philz coffee so it's hard to compare, but I think the Marymint is a little creamier. Also had the banana nutella waffle, bananas and nutella are always a winning combination, can't go wrong there. No wifi yet but I'm sure it will come soon. Friendly staff, delicious offerings, antique filament lightbulbs and best of all, Bieber and MJ high above on a mural watching over you. This place is aces.

              "Guys, this place is amazing. Limited food menu but both waffle offerings will blow you away! Crazy good spices on the chicken. The coffee and matcha were both stellar as well. Service was friendly and efficient. The space is stunning and cozy. Highly recommend.

              "What a fantastic atmosphere. I dropped in to catch up on some work and found a fantastic atmosphere and a great staff. I wish I could work here every day. I had the Darling pour-over and olive bread, and camped out near the pop-art fabric fire in the fireplace nook. Wallace (owner) and his team were spot-on with service and help. Full disclosure: The place is so beautiful on the inside that I Instagrammed it - couldn't help it, I claimed it for my own, like dozens of other folks.

              "- The Third Time is a Charm! The Factory has A+ decor and a very innovative interactionless (tablet) ordering system. This allows you to look up what to get without feeling pressured by a barista staring at you waiting for you to order. The eclectic selection of tables, couches, and swings (?!) inside with a small kiddy corner appeal to many different types of tastes. This is seriously a cool place to hang out.  However, when it comes to the coffee and food, it's rather not cheap. The waffles range from $4-$8, and coffee is between $3.50 and $5. The quality of the coffee is not yet up to par with other coffee mainstays in Austin, so I would probably not choose to come here just for coffee. However, it is a CUTE date place and I know that M and I will probably come back to chat, people-watch, or read books.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              4\n",

              "Checked out The Factory this past Sunday with my husband. We wanted to try their delicious looking waffles and were definitely not disappointed.  Husband ordered an iced coffee drink that was delicious, but it wasn't as good as my Golden Age of Milk Tea, well worth the 10 minute wait for the tea to steep.  We both ordered the Nutella Waffle and it was perfect. From the wood plate with the AMAZING paper liner printed with a famous person and an inspirational quote from them. I wanted just the paper because it was so cute and well done. The waffle is basically half a waffle, spread with Nutella and a layer of bananas, then folded in half. While small, it was a perfect amount, the bananas balancing out the sweetness of the Nutella. The waffle itself was crisp perfection, providing a crunch to the meal. The menu is very limited: there was the nutella waffle and a fried chicken waffle. I'm hoping they'll eventually serve other waffles, but totally respect their decision to start small.  The space is gorgeous. From the swings to the mural above the bar, everything looks meticulously planned out. And here is where my biggest advice comes: this place is really not for kids. The way the seating is set up is really for larger people and there is definitely no place for high chairs. While there is giant magnetic poetry on one of the columns, a crazy chair outside and a couple of table games, the giant chess set looks risky for grabby kids. If you have a well-behaved child who can handle it, I would think its fine. However, I watched several families come in and either leave or order to go, commenting it wasn't the best space for them. While this doesn't bother me (I love kidless spaces), it might be jarring to someone expecting to have brunch with the family.  I am so excited to become a regular here! Great new spot!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  4\n",
              "This place has been shown on my social media for days so i finally visited! One of THE cutest and artistic looking coffeeshops I have ever visited. You can self order which is nice because you can take your time and look at the pictures to help you decide! I especially liked how pictures were shown so I knew which coffee/tea came out aesthetically  I ordered the famous matcha green latte and i dont usually drink coffee but it went beyond my expectations. They give you a good amount and its creamy and sweet. Only downside is no wifi.. So hard to study here.

              "A cafe that doesn't have Wifi but makes you order from an iPad. Seriously? $2 extra for almond milk?! The latte was already $5 for 12 oz. Don't expect to have a lot of Vegan customers. There's a serious lack of customer service for the  overpriced food and beverages.  You order from an iPad, and they call out your drink. There is no interaction between the customer and employee, and they still expect a tip? This cafe also advertises that they have games. There are two games, chess and tick tax toe. It is a beautiful cafe, with very cool furnishings. However I wont be going back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      4\n",
              "Okay, so after visiting my friends in LA and trying a mint mojito iced coffee, I had to find one in Austin that's comparable. It was getting very difficult to find one to begin with, let alone a good one. I saw the mint coffee on the factory's website and had to try it. Unfortunately I was shell-shocked at the price tag ($7 if I remember correctly??)  I figured it would be a large drink and particularly fabulous and hopefully large to make up for the over the top price (this is $3 more than philz)   Was it particularly fabulous? No. It was good, it wasn't as good as philz. Was it bigger?? No. It was about 4 ounces of  coffee, tops. Will I be back? Absolutely not, especially considering I can get a 20 oz mint mojito coffee from tea haus for $3 less that tastes just as good.  This place is also self service (for ordering and pick up), why that would lead to inflated prices and not a price decrease is far beyond my understanding. I don't recommend it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             4\n",
              "This is a tough one for me.  I took my children here as a treat one afternoon and our first impression was good.  I liked the decor and the place has swings and a chess set!  Score for the kids! I went to place my order and had to use an ipad.  It was DIY-ordering.  I hit the wrong button of course and ended up messing up my order and having to redo the whole thing.  Not too thrilled with the ipad idea but I moved on.  I sat down and when our drinks were ready, they called my name to go get them.  They had a tip jar on the counter.  I have an issue with this since I had to place my own order and then go get my own drink.  I'm not sure what they did extra that constitutes a tip?  The milk tea was delicious!  The kids loved their drinks and \"pop tarts.\"  I started glancing at some of the books laying on the table and the first one I picked up was on tattoos and had a few nude people inside.  I pushed that one aside to be sure the kids didn't pick it up.  I went to use the restroom and framed on the hall wall was a picture with the F-word all over it.  Hmm, not my idea of tasteful art.  I was glad my children didn't need to use the bathroom.  While my milk tea was good, I wouldn't go back.  It was very expensive for what you get and I'd have to blindfold the children.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          4\n",

The seating arrangements and atmosphere are definitely fun. One thing is that there's no internet, so don't plan on coming here to get stuff done!  You get to order on an ipad! yay.  Pros: - the drink choices are really great. You can get something that you want. You can even get beer here. - great for pictures and enjoying some time off. Sit on a swing ... while playing chase. - parking is plentiful in the plaza area. - friendly baristas  Cons: - food menu isn't too big, but that's okay. Not gluten free for the wife. - very pricey. If you need a place to come on a weekly basis, you're going to need to be a balla.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          4\n",

              "First to Review The Factory is AWESOME! What a great spot! I had the chicken and waffles (new take, but I now have cravings for them!), the homemade Poptart was so fun and such a delight. In terms of beverages got the drink with the chicory in it (I'm a big chicory fan) and it was perfect!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             4\n",
              "This place is so cute. New favorite coffee spot on Burnet/in Northcross. Almost wish I was still in grad school,  so I would have an excuse to be there everyday.  Amazing coffee and best chicken & waffles ever! The chicken was seasoned perfectly and made for a delicious savory brunch (with the house made slaw they give you on the side). The olive oil cake was also awesome, light and sweet. Perfect coffee companion. My husband and I will definitely be back, as we loved everything and felt it was all very reasonable priced. Olive oil cake, chicken & waffle and 15-minutes-of-fame coffee! So good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       4\n",
              "My best friend and I came to The Factory after seeing it on a couple of best new Austin brunch lists. It's super cute and trendy, to the point where it feels kind of out of place in a strip mall. Although I loved the interior design and general ambiance of the place, I was a little disappointed with the menu. This is more of a coffee shop than a cafe - their food options are pretty limited. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and I ordered Nutella waffles with strawberries and bananas. For the price I paid, the portions were definitely on the smaller side. I enjoyed my meal still, but it's hard to mess up Nutella and fruit, so I wasn't particularly impressed. I would love to come back to study sometime but since they don't have wifi, I don't think it'll be likely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   4\n",
              "Note: Do not come here if you're looking for a place to work remotely! There is no WiFi and no outlets. Staff says they are hoping to create an environment where people socialize and enjoy each other's company rather than being on their phones.  For a spot to catch up with friends over coffee and pastries, I highly recommend coming here! There is ample seating, an open layout, and a lot to look at  and talk about including wooden swings, books and a chess board on a table, and a cute corner of pillows in another corner.  They serve coffee drinks, waffles, and pastries. The pop tart was extremely sweet, so much so that I was unable to finish even half. Their cortado was pretty good. The food and drinks are quite pricey here, which makes me question returning.  Presentation and ambience wise, I give this place 5 stars!

              "I was so pleasantly surprised by this place! I only went because I had time to kill and they were the only coffee shop nearby open until 2 am. But I'm so glad I tried it out. It's not your typical Austin coffee shop. The quality of the drinks here was top notch, and they offer unique food and drinks. I had the macha latte (I think that's what it was called) and it was fantastic! The people were so friendly, the decor was beautiful, with plenty of comfortable seating (including swings from the ceiling!), and it was just the perfect place to chill with friends. I'll definitely be coming back!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          4\n",
              "Listed in Brunch Spots I loved the eclectic and homey plush decor and who doesn't want to swing and drink their coffee?  I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make brunch so we headed out in search of chicken and waffles.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seat and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold brew coffee, chicken and waffles and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The chicken and waffles wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the waffle was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.  A great place to be cozy and chat with your friends, a date or read a book.

              "Listed in In Search of Fantastic Coffee So, I really didn't want to write this review. I didn't want to tell anyone how awesome The Factory - Cafe With a Soul is because I don't want it overrun and super busy with no place to sit like so many other decent coffee shops in Austin. I happened to come in here with a friend mid-week and we sat here for several hours, enjoying the peace and quiet, the atmosphere, and the awesome coffee.  This place is a little eclectic - lots of peculiar art, books, games, knick-knacks, and an almost head-scratching drink and food menu. Waffles and pop tarts...and beer? And... coffee mojitos? Well, it works. Whatever is going on here, it works fabulously. They serve Stumptown Coffee, which as someone from the Northwest, I totally appreciate. They also brew coffee correctly. There is not a hint of bitterness or overcooked milk going on here. The iPad ordering screens are mostly cool, (although they need more options for customization) and the million different types of seating, (couches, pillows, swings, big chairs, little chairs, bar seating, regular tables) is both delightful and refreshing. The baristas make foam art - something that I have only seen at Houndstooth here in Austin. Hanging out here was a wonderful experience - this is a five star establishment, the best coffee house I've been to in Austin, and I will be back - time and time again.

              "They are located within the Northcross mall shopping center facing east toward Burnet Rd with plenty of parking. I loved their computerized user friendly ordering system, it made it easy me to pick & choose all the items I wanted to try. I ordered pop tart, chicken & waffles, strawberry waffles (photos uploaded). This place is ideal for ordering a few dishes to share with your group.

              "This locally owned coffee lovers' mecca and remote working hotspot is hot for good reason.  In my two year relationship with this establishment (as well as it's sister wine bar) I've never felt anything but welcome and appreciated as a customer.    The single time I had issue with a service problem not only was my order free, I was given a gift card to use later.  The manager loves that we use them as a cycling launch point.  Fresh water to refill our bottles and (unrestricted) use of the restrooms are just the beginning. This is a customer service-driven establishment.  That my fellow neighborhood rats are feeling the long term relationship potential as well - it's full of regulars every time I visit - is just more proof of the quality found at Lola's!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
              "Perfect place to study with your laptops, since there are so many tables and outlets. There was a lack of light at some corners tho, so be aware of that. Food and drinks are also good and decent priced. My friends got stuff from their mocha menus and absolutely loved it. My hazelnut latte was nice too. Bonus: the \"You're my butter half\" wall is right across from the cafe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",
              "I love Third Coast. They're the best neighbor, ever. The coffee is superb, the employees are incredibly helpful and bean-nerdy, and the price is right, especially if you take the extra time to buy direct from the roasterie. They have a coffee bar area right when you walk in, and usually have a free coffee brewed to try while you're buying.  Just so you know: No, they are not a coffee shop, they are a local roasterie and only do distribution of ground and bean coffee by the pound to other businesses, or individuals that stop by/order.  I love dark roasts, and the Double French is amazing. You rock, Third Coast!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
              "So happy I now have yet another stop for Boba not to far away from home.  If you're in the area (this is perfect after getting a bowl of Veggie Pho from PhoNatic), do yourself a favor & stop by Tea Haus.  What to get?  Check it:  Iced Grapefruit Green Tea: Such a delicious, refreshing drink.  This is perfect for the summer days of the ATX.  Brick Toast: Umm, YUM!  I still can't wrap my head around how they make these suckers, but they are so sweet & delicious.    Milk Tea w/ Boba: This definitely more than satisfies my craving when I need, need, need a Boba drink.  Such a cute establishment with great service.

Anyway, I might be back to try pastries and a drink, but I was so excited to have another breakfast taco stop near work and now I'm just sad :(                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",
              "This place was cute. I ordered an iced almond milk latte and it was great - creamy with plenty of espresso coming through. There was only one employee trying to make the coffee, take orders and work the register, so it took a little while, but it wasn't a big deal and she was nice about it. The coffeeshop is connected to a really cool bookstore and boutique you can browse in while drinking your coffee, and there is one or two tables to sit at, but don't come here with a large group of friends and expect to sit and chat or work for a long time. If I'm in the area and want someplace that's a little more low-keu, I'd come here again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",
              "This place screams Austin.  Hungry on a Saturday morning, my friend and I arrived to Pacha and found a parking space in the back immediately. Parking is available in the street if no parking spaces are available in the lot. Pacha is a little cozy restaurant - homey like with charm.  There are about 10 tables inside with additional 5 tables outside when the weather permits. Menu is decently extensive with breakfast and lunch options. We arrived when there was a couple in front of us, but the line can got worse after 11:30AM. That line was to the door, and the cashier inside yelled twice to keep the door shut.  There is a wait time for when you receive your food order - written next to the Coffee/Drinks board. It was 35 minutes when we arrived, but the wait time can be greater than 1 hour. Small kitchen, so they are most likely lacking in the number of cooks vs orders ratio.  Food: Beef Hash (3/5, 100% grass fed beef with grilled potatoes, leeks, carrots, celery, and turnip, served with wilted green with 2 eggs any style): I was not impressed by this - just okay. I ordered my eggs sunny up slightly easy, and those were made perfect! The serving is not filling in my opinion for the price I paid. It was kind of bland despite being seasoned, so I used some Habanero hot sauce that made it twice as better than before!  French Toast (4/5, Sourdough toast soaked in spiced egg butter with maple pecan espresso butter): Can be served solo, with 2 eggs, meat, or all. This was delicious! Light and fluffy! I loved the sourdough toast with the different take on the butter. It was not too sweet in my opinion - just the right amount. Apparently, you can switch the toast if you are not a fan of sourdough. The french toast alone is not fulfilling, so you should pay for the additional eggs and meat.  A few choices on the menu stood out but not being a big pancake person, I opted for the Beef Hash and French Toast. Personally, I'd try to order food items that are made fresh instead of things from the display. At Pacha, they endorse local made/grown products with 90% of the food prepared being organic.  Yes, I would come back to try the breakfast tacos and that Pear Bacon Pancake! Plan your visit though - parking, wait and food time, and seating.

              "I've only lived in Austin about 13 days and I've probably been to this place about six times already.  Everyone who works there is always nice, and they serve Tacodeli tacos which are freaking delicious.  I've had a couple different types of coffee drinks. Iced coffee, cold brew, americano, etc. Their coffee has a very clear acidity that I honestly just don't really like. I can tell the coffee is great but I think its a matter of personal taste. I'll definitely keep coming back though, because it's close to where I work and again, everyone is just always so nice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
              "Iced coffee tastes so good when it's cold brew and there's 6+ different sugar and milk options to add. Good place to get some work done. A little dark, but has a cute East Austin charm that isn't overwhelming or pungent in any sense. Wouldn't mind if it was 24 hours. Will be returning to try other drinks, if their iced coffee wasn't so addicting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",

              "I had just had brunch at Hi Hat and was in the mood for some espresso. This being just a block down the street seemed like a good place to walk to to get one on a beautiful day. The woman taking my order and making the espresso was very nice. The woman who checked me out was not as nice, but nice nonetheless. The espresso itself was good, not exceptional, but good and it got the job done. I'm all about espresso, but they have a number of other coffee options and all looked pretty great.  Parking in the area is easy. Service was quick. The inside area is super clean and chill. I sat outside and took in the great weather. A good place to stop by for a decent coffee when in the area. Espresso plus water with \"gas\" as they'd say in Europe                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",

              "La Tazza serves up quite the tasty brew. i'm sure they add cinnamon/nutmeg or some sort of spice to their coffee because it smells divine! Plus, refills are only $.50!  I somehow always end up studying at a table where the display of pastries and baked goods are in full view. I honestly don't know how much longer I'll be able to resist the beaconing of the chocolate cake with oreos... I do appreciate their wide variety of sandwiches, cookies, muffins, cakes, and other pastries though!  The one con to this place is they tend to keep the temperature on the warmer side. Even though have several ceiling fans running inside, the brutal Texas summer heat is hard to escape.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",

              "Dude. I can't even.  This place is really amazing. Atmosphere, Drinks (Best Cold Brew in town, hands down), Tacos, Staff. All A+++. Family owned and run, this neighborhood shop has got your favorite chain beat. Just try it once, you'll be amazed.  Atmosphere: It's hidden in a small strip mall, and if you blink you'll miss it. So, don't blink because its totally worth it. Inside is warm and cozy, and always has great music on. There is also a selection of local handmade hats, scarves and jewelry. Yeah, that's right. The noise level is usually pretty quite, with occasional crowds that make it get to the average level, but there always a few people working on their laptops so the noise level stays pretty low.  Drinks: So this is where they really shine and what ultimately drew me in as a regular. The cold brew here is stunning, and it takes a lot to impress me. I've driven all over this town and tried everyone's cold brew. Then I found Corona, and it changed my life. I know that sounds dramatic, and it is. But it's also true. Talking with the management about their approach to coffee, it becomes quite clear that they take this sh*t seriously! Their knowledge and skills are unparalleled. Other than the cold brew, they have a whole assortment of gourmet drinks. And I mean, Gour-freaking-met! The Pulsar (caramel mocha with himalayan salt) is my favorite. But the Corona Borealis (Kashmiri green tea chai latte topped with fresh saffron, cardamom and cinnamon) is my other favorite. Freaking Saffron!  Tacos: They carry Taco-Mex tacos. The migas is delicious, but the egg, cactus and black bean is also very popular. The spicy green salsa is creamy and delicious!  Staff: They are all so knowledgeable and friendly. This family establishment really cares about their customers and you will see it in the numerous regulars that come and go all day. I always have a great time when I come here. Which is about four times a week.

              "Dolce Neve never ceases to impress me!  Pros: -Every time I come, there are new flavors to try. Whoever comes up with the unique flavor pairings is churning gelato with his/her heart and soul. -the servers were patient and gave us so many samples before we could decide what to order! -sorbet or gelato, it's all darn good! I especially like their multiple variations of chocolate, and lemon gelato.  Neutral: -I dunno if it's because of sheer luck that every time I've gone, my friends and I have found a table to sit as well as a parking space.

              "Listed in Treats from Mobile Eats, The '23 I loooooove this little coffee truck. Keturah, the owner, is selling really good coffee out of the cutest little Studebaker. Everyone who works there is super friendly, and the coffee is STRONG. I usually get iced and it is perfection (and this is coming from a major coffee snob). It's also very reasonably priced ($2.50 for iced). This has become my go-to coffee spot when I run out at home and want my coffee to go.

They have the roasting going on out in the open so you can see what's up, smell beans and talk coffee with the other coffee nerds. We grabbed a couple of bags to bring home. Both smelled really unique and I am dying to put them in my mouth :) The coffee we tried when we were there was the Nicaragua. It was bright without being overly acidic and tasted like something you would want to drink with a good book and a cat in your lap. Think comfort food coffee. We will be back next time we are in town for sure.

              "This location has more of a cold atmosphere to it, for sure.  I work in a cold office environment already and would love an escape wen I sneak away for some caffeine.  The quality of the brew is just as good as the other location, and I understand it's in an industrial building and not an old house like the Clarksville location, but I'm a bit sad that I can't tuck away in it and feel cozy.  I do like all the natural light.  On a side note, the inside reminds me sooo much of my days spent in Insomnia on the drag in high school and college. It's the less dingy, smoke free, and friendlier version of the same floor plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",
              "I've been thinking about how I could do this place justice with some words on the internet...for DAYS...and I just can't. I mean, how do you properly communicate to someone the stream of tears you cried, doubled over laughing hysterically or the number of times your ass came up off of your seat in a fit of laughter?!  I came across The Big Bash event listing a few weeks ago while looking for something interesting to do as part of my 30th birthday festivities. This seemed fitting. I had zero idea what to expect, but can I just say that any expectations I did have coming in here were blown out of the water in the first couple of acts.  I've seriously never laughed so hard in my life. It's better than Whose Line is it Anyway, but the same idea...improv that encourages suggestions from the audience and even audience participation. That's right folks, I volunteered to \"help out\", but when they said I'd be doing sound effects for everything Roy did I about passed out. I don't do sound effects...and I definitely don't do them while I'm cracking up. I was in literal tears by the time I sat back down.  I could not have been more impressed with this production or the people in it. Roy, one of the improvers, was also the person I was in contact with ahead of time, and he graciously reserved seats together for our party. So professional and you can tell these entertainers are totally invested in their craft. Otherwise, it wouldn't have been nearly as impressive.  I'm already planning a return trip!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",
              "My roommate loves to study at coffee shops, so I tend to tag along when she invites me. Epoch is conveniently located near where we live, so when it's possible, we walk there. The parking lot gets pretty crowded (typical Austin), and nothing is more of a deterrent from studying than when parking becomes frustrating.  I've never been to Epoch in the day time just because I tend to study better in the evening. It's always a gamble whether I'll find a table or not when I get there because Epoch is always busy at night (yay 24 hour coffee shop!). Pounce on a table when you spy someone packing up to leave.  The wifi here is pretty dependable. Though I have a sneaky suspicion that they'll turn off the wifi (and crank the AC up) to get rid of customers around midnight. I've made it past the point of no wifi and freezing temperatures (around 1AM), and I can affirm that they do turn the wifi back on.  The coffee is decent and will tide you through studying, but nothing really stands out to me. I'd highly recommend the chocolate cake though. They give you a large slice, and it's rich and moist.  Service is alright. It meets my standard of hipster coffee shop service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",
              "Very disappointed on walking in from our Hotel 5 blocks away. It is a nice morning. Hours on door and Yelp are 7a.m. Fortunately it was 8:02 since they now open at 8:00 instead. Be warned, they don't have their food available until 9. No mention of that. So we will sit here, have a cup of coffee, which they did have and decide where to go for breakfast.  Have to edit, since the manager graciously asked to nice girl helping us to offer us these cookies. BTW, just got our coffees, 15 minutes later. Glad we are the only ones here.
